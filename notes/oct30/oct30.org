#+Title: Analytic tableaux

* Rules
  We've begun discussing analytic tableaux, which provide a method of proving
  contradictions in (classical) first-order logic by breaking (signed) formulae
  down into smaller (signed) formulae, according to both the sign and the main
  connective of the relevant formula.

  Using this method, we represent the results of breaking a formula down into
  pieces as a tableau. A tableau is just a tree whose nodes are signed formulae.
  The rules associated with each connective provide general schema for /expanding/
  some tableau, i.e., by somehow adding new signed formulae to it.

  Each connective, $∧$, $∨$, $¬$, $∀$, and $∃$ has its own set of rules, as
  follows. Here, each rule is represented by a tree containing the
  /to-be-expanded/ node as the root node and the formulae that a given tableau is
  expanded with as child nodes.
  
** Conjunction rules

   True conjunctions are expanded by introducing child nodes on which each of
   the conjuncts is true.

   False conjunctions cause a given path of the tableau to branch into two
   paths: one in which the left conjunct is false, and one in which the right
   conjunct is false. Thus to show that the the tableau is contradictory, we
   need to show that a contradiction is introduced along both paths, since we
   don't know which conjunct is false.
   
** Disjunction rules

   True disjunctions are expanded by branching into two separate paths, one
   where each disjunct is true. That is, to show that a disjunction results in a
   contradiction, it is sufficient to show that /both/ of its disjuncts lead to a
   contradiction.

   False disjunctions branch by making each disjunct false along the same path.
   
** Negation rules

   A true negation becomes an unnegated false thing, and a false negation
   becomes an unnegated true thing!
   
** γ rules

   If it is true that every $x$ is such that $φ(x)$, you can pick any name $n$
   you want and expand the path by saying it is true that $φ(n)$, since $φ$ will
   certainly be true of $n$.

   If it is false that some $x$ is such that $φ(x)$, you can pick any name $n$
   you want and expand the path by saying it is false that $φ(n)$, since $φ$
   will be false of $n$ (if it were true of $n$, then there would be some $n$
   such that $φ(n)$ and $(∃x.φ(x))$ would be true).
   
** δ rules
   #+attr_html: :width 300
   [[./deltarules.png]]

   If it is false that every $x$ is such that $φ(x)$, that means there must be
   some $x$ such that it is false that $φ(x)$ (if there weren't such an $x$,
   then it would be /true/ that every $x$ is such that $φ(x)$). Since we don't
   know which $x$ makes the universal statement false, we should just expand the
   path by picking a fresh name $n_{\text{fresh}}$, i.e., which hasn't occurred
   anywhere on the path yet, and saying it is false that $φ(n_{\text{fresh}})$.

   Similar reasoning applies to a true existential formula. If it is true that
   there is some $x$ such that $φ(x)$, then we should add $φ(n_{\text{fresh}})$,
   for some name $n_{\text{fresh}}$ which hasn't occurred yet anywhere on the
   path. In other words, it doesn't matter what we call the relevant $x$, as
   long as we haven't identified it with anything else we've made claims about
   on the same path.
   
* An example
  Goal: show that $(∀x.P(x) → (∃y.P(y)))$ is a theorem.
